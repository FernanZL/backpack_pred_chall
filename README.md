# Data Preprocessing and Regression Model Training for Backpack Price.

This proyect consists of data preprocessing and training of a regression model for Kaggle's Backpack Prediction Challenge. You can download the data from the competition's [page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/data)

## Included Files

- 'backpack_pred_chall.ipynb': notebook containing the preprocessing and model.

## Requirements

To run the project, Python 3.9 and the following libraries are required:  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn 
- jupyter  
- lightgbm  
- optuna  

To install the dependencies, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn lightgbm optuna jupyter
```

## Download the Dataset
Before running the project, download the dataset from Kaggle, using the link provided above and place it in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook ('backpack_pred_chall.ipynb').

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
If you don't have Git installed, first [install](https://git-scm.com/) it, then run this command in your terminal to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FernanZL/bakcpack_pred_chall.git
```

2. Install the dependencies
Once you have cloned the repository, install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn lightgbm optuna jupyter
```

3. Open the notebook
To open the notebook in Jupyter, run the following command in the terminal:
